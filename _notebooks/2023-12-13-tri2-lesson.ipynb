For example, when we want a storage to always be sorted, while we could use some sort of binary search method to find the best position to insert a value, there are just data structures, such as TreeSet, that maintains sorted status upon insertion. It's important to use the data structure that best suits your need in the right context."

    "### Real world applications of Collections\n",
    "In the context of an application or a database, a collection can allow for large amounts of values to be stored efficiently without creating large amounts of variables, storing what's usually a column of information in a single cell (I guess then, then that's also a collection of collection in of itself). It can be used for when you don't know how long that a list can be, you can modify the values in a collection easily also. However, the usage of many collections can add a lot of unnecessary weight on the database due to the extra spaces used, and it can be hard to keep track of what functions should be used for modifying certain values in a collection."
